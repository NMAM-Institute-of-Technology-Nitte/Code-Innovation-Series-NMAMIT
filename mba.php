        <h5>About this Specialization</h5>
        <p>
        The iMBA is career-focused. Students develop leadership and management skills that help them thrive in today’s business environment. 
        Challenging team-based projects, face-to-face class sessions with faculty and peers, and a selection of 8 different Specializations make this MBA curriculum unmatched in flexibility and impact.
        Students in the iMBA program earn the same high-quality MBA degree that on-campus students have been earning for decades--but without needing to put career or family life on hold. 
        Students achieve business mastery, gain lifelong leadership skills, and build a global network as they work alongside fellow students and faculty.
        The iMBA program features live global classrooms via web conferencing, team projects, and personal interaction with professors during virtual office hours. 
        The nearly 2,000 students in the iMBA family represent more than 90 countries and 48 states across the United States. 
        The program was hailed as a “breakthrough” by Poets & Quants, a leading authority on management education. 
        The iMBA is from Gies College of Business at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, a historical land-grant public research institution founded in 1867.
